Studies about design patterns.

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability. In addition, they can be categorized by their intent and divided into three groups.

#### Creational patterns
Provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

#### Structural patterns
Explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.

#### Behavioral patterns
Take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
